Mediapipe is an open-source framework developed by Google that provides a collection of pre-built, configurable machine learning models for various tasks, including face and hand analysis. These models are trained on large datasets and can accurately detect and analyze facial landmarks and hand gestures in real-time.

Combining deep learning with electronics opens up a wide array of possibilities, allowing for the creation of intelligent systems capable of perceiving, analyzing, and responding to the environment in real-time.
